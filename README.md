# Simple Readability

This program is a simple trading robot that analyzes the market and places trades based on the generated market analysis report. It is developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team and can be downloaded from their website [forexroboteasy.com](https://forexroboteasy.com).

## Functionality
The program uses technical indicators and market data to generate a market analysis report. It checks if there is a potential trading opportunity based on the analysis and places a trade if one is found. The program runs on the MetaTrader platform and is designed to place trades automatically.

## Dependencies
The program requires the following libraries to be imported:
- `stdlib.mqh`
- `trade.mqh`
- `chartobjects.mqh`

## Global Variables
- `lastTradeTime` - Stores the timestamp of the last trade placed.
- `tradeVolume` - Stores the number of trades placed.

## Initialization
The `OnInit` function is called when the program starts. It sets the `lastTradeTime` variable to the current time.

## Trading Signals
The `OnTick` function is called on every tick of the market. It checks if it is time to place a trade by comparing the current time with the `lastTradeTime`. If the specified time interval (1 hour in this case) has passed, it generates a market analysis report and checks if there is a potential trading opportunity. If an opportunity is found, it calls the `PlaceTrade` function to place a trade. Finally, it updates the `lastTradeTime` variable with the current time.

## Market Analysis
The `GenerateMarketAnalysis` function is responsible for generating the market analysis report. This function is currently a placeholder and needs to be implemented with the actual analysis logic. The function returns a string representing the market analysis report.

## Trading Opportunity
The `IsTradingOpportunity` function checks the market analysis report and determines if there is a potential trading opportunity. This function is currently a placeholder and needs to be implemented with the actual trading opportunity logic. The function takes the market analysis report as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether there is a trading opportunity or not.

## Trade Placement
The `PlaceTrade` function is responsible for placing a trade. This function is currently a placeholder and needs to be implemented with the actual trade placement logic. It updates the `tradeVolume` variable, creates a text object on the chart to display trade information, and sets the text, font size, and color of the trade information.

## Program Shutdown
The `OnDeinit` function is called when the program is shut down. It is responsible for cleaning up any resources used by the trading robot. This function is currently a placeholder and needs to be implemented with the actual program shutdown logic.
